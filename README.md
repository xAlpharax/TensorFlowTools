# TensorFlowTools

Tools that enable the use of shortcuts while experimenting and implementing ML Research Papers in code, but also useful to mess around. Just code I want to save and use later on, nothing too crazy.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
import tensormanipulation

print(tensormanipulation.normalization([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))
```
